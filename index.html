    <h1>My favorite Music</h1>
    <p id="introduction"> This webpage is dedicated to sharing a little bit about some of my favorite genres, favorite artists, and favorite bands.
        Over the past few years my music taste has really expanded and become rather broad. Ever since I was a kid, I have always been a huge fan
        of punk, and rap. However, my taste in music has really expanded into many other genres including pop, indie, and even some
        <em>country</em> music as well.
